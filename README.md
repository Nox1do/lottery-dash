# Lottery Scraping and Results Visualization System

## Project Overview

This is a lottery scraping and results visualization system consisting of two main parts:

1. **Backend (Python/Flask):**
   - Scraping of lottery results from multiple states.
   - Results caching to optimize performance.
   - REST API to serve the data.

2. **Frontend (JavaScript/React):**
   - Dashboard to visualize results.
   - Automatic data updates.
   - Responsive interface.

## Main Components

### 1. Scraper (`scraper.py`)
- Performs web scraping of the [lotteryusa.com](https://www.lotteryusa.com) website.
- Handles multiple states (e.g., Tennessee, Texas).
- Implements a caching system (TTLCache).
- Batch processing to optimize performance.
- Error handling and retries.

### 2. API (`app.py`)
- Flask server with CORS enabled.
- Main endpoint: `/api/lottery-results`.
- Caching system for results.
- Date and timezone handling.
- Structured JSON responses.

## Key Features

### 1. Performance Optimization
- **10-minute TTL cache**: Results are cached to reduce repeated scraping.
- **Batch processing**: Processes results in batches for efficiency.
- **Concurrent workers**: Limited to 3 to manage server load.
- **Timeouts**: Configured for optimal performance and reliability.

### 2. Error Handling
- **Exponential backoff retries**: Handles temporary issues by retrying with increasing delays.
- **Cache fallback**: Uses cached data in case of errors during scraping.
- **Detailed logging**: Provides insights into scraping process and errors.
- **Results validation**: Ensures accurate data retrieval.

### 3. State-Specific Configuration
- CSS selectors tailored for specific states.
- Default configuration for unspecified states.
- Support for multiple games (e.g., Pick 3, Pick 4).

### 4. Date Processing
- Eastern Time timezone.
- Support for multiple date formats.
- Validation for current dates.

## Project Goals

This project is designed to:
1. **Collect real-time lottery results** from multiple sources.
2. **Efficiently handle large data volumes** with optimized scraping and caching.
3. **Provide a robust and reliable API** to serve lottery data.
4. **Offer an intuitive user interface** for visualizing results.
5. **Ensure data consistency** with a caching system.
